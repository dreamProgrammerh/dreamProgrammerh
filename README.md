\
**Full-System Programmer & Digital Craftsman**\
\
I am obsessed with the fundamental art of creation.\
My passion lies in building complex systems from the ground up,\
with a deep reverence for performance, elegance, and control.\
\
I DON'T JUST USE TOOLS!\
\* I understand, reinvent, and build them.

  <summary><b>What I Enjoy :)</b></summary>
I find joy in creating the very ground upon which software is built.<br>
<br>
I have a deep affinity for C!<br>
- manual memory management<br>
- and squeezing the most out of hardware.<br>
Writing clean, fast, and highly maintainable code is a core tenet of my work.<br>
<br>
I possess a strong sense of UI/UX design,<br>
believing that powerful software must also be intuitive and a pleasure to use.<br>

  <summary><b>What Am Picky About :\</b></summary>
&nbsp; I have a low tolerance for the overhead and abstraction of modern framework churn.<br>
&nbsp; I often prefer the clarity and control of a bespoke solution over the convenience of a bloated dependency.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>My drive is simple:</b></summary>
&nbsp; to understand, to build, and to optimize.<br>
&nbsp; I am always seeking the perfect balance between raw performance and sublime user experience.
